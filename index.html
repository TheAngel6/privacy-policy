        <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Image Generator</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 25-06-2025</p>

        <p>Thank you for using AI Image Generator ("the Bot"). This Privacy Policy is here to help you understand what information the Bot processes, how it's used, and your rights.</p>

        <p>By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Process</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to be as privacy-respecting as possible. The Bot itself does not store any of your personal data, such as your Discord username, ID, or the content of your commands, in any database we control.</p>
        <p>However, to generate images, the text prompt you provide is processed by the Bot. This information is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored or logged by our Bot.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide the image generation feature, the Bot uses the <strong>Cloudflare AI</strong> platform. When you issue a command to generate an image, your prompt is sent to Cloudflare to be processed by their AI models. Your use of our Service means you acknowledge that this data is handled by Cloudflare for the purpose of providing the service and for their own platform monitoring.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to review their privacy policy to understand how they handle data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>We do not operate a database or any other means of persistently storing your data. All interactions with the Bot are handled ephemerally to fulfill your command request.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us on our official support server:</p>
